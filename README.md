#####  Project Summary

This project compared multiple machine learning classifiers — including KNN, SVC, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost — using metrics like **Accuracy**, **ROC-AUC**, and **PRC-AP**.  
Ensemble models, particularly **XGBoost (AUC = 0.991, AP = 0.961)**, delivered the best balance between precision and recall.  
A deliberately poor model (SVC with sigmoid kernel) showed **AUC < 0.5** and **AP = 0.167**, performing worse than random guessing.  
The experiment highlighted how **model choice, kernel selection, and threshold behavior** critically impact classification performance.
